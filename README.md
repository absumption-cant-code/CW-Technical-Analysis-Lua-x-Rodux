# Technical-Analysis-Lua
A small file to demonstrate the usage of Rodux for Combat Warriors.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Technical-Analysis-Lua.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Technical-Analysis-Lua.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and test play with your console open.

You should see the following within your console,

```lua
{
    User = {
        name = "Absumption" (string)
        id = 41312758 (number)
        preferredName = "michael" (string)
        isInfluential = false (boolean)
        isPremium = false (boolean)
    }
    Monetization = {
        gamepasses = {
        }
        subscriptions = {
            1 = {
                id = 0 (number)
                type = "DevProduct" (string)
                date = 99999 (number)
                active = true (boolean)
            }
        }
        history = {
            1 = {
                id = 0 (number)
                type = "DevProduct" (string)
                date = 142342 (number)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
